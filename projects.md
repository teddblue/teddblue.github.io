# Here's what I'm working on!
I usually have multiple projects running at the same time, you can view my public ones here!

## [gamebois](https://teddblue.github.io/gamebois)
my largest ongoing project! Here you can play retro games as well as flash games. I've spent the past year coding it by hand as I learned HTML, javascript, JSON, and CSS.

	fun fact: the game selection buttons are generated automatically in javascript by reading a JSON file.
	
	fun fact 2: gamebois' github repository is automatically mirrored to a gitlab repository, I did this the manual way. you can view it by clicking the link below
